To work with PPS 2.0 you need to install Font Awesome web fonts package manager, so:
-  download [qpm package manager](https://www.qpm.io/). 
-  put qpm.exe in PPS project folder.
-  use `qpm install` in command line.
-  `include($$PWD/vendor/vendor.pri)` in pllug-presentation-system.pro file.
-  to use FontAwesome you need to `import com.cutehacks.fontawesome 1.0` in appropriate qml file.
